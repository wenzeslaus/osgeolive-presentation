                     <p>Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source projects when defining reference implementations for standards.</p>
                     <p>OSGeo-Live includes overviews of some of the key OGC standards in simple language so they can be understood by people without a technical background.</p>
                     <p>Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications. It facilitates sharing data between agencies. It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance, and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>

                     <p>GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.</p>
                     <p>It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.</p>
                     <p>With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.</p>

                     <p>In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software. Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.</p>

                     <p>Generic Mapping Tools, or GMT is a collection of tools that allow users to manipulate (x,y) and (x,y,z) data sets for filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, and so on. It supports the production of journal quality cartographic illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots through to contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views in black and white, gray tone, hachure patterns, and 24-bit color.</p>

                     <p>R and its packages are able to process point, line, polygon and grid data. Users can accomplish a broad array of tasks such as: image classification and statistical analysis to infer spatial relationships and patterns of features.</p>
